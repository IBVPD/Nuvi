TODO:

- IDs updated when changed
- Reverse mapping tests (uploading epi after url)

- Downloadable unlinked/linked data resultsâ€¦
- Combine site performance report into a global report


From Teleconference Call:

Import:
- Collection time - type excel date vs datetime

Export:
- column name should be the same as core variables
- date export always includes time.
- Variable names return to underscore or check
- Create user issue

Reports:
- Export the performance indicator.

1. For the "site performance" one, can you make the style consistent? Either all arrows or all circles.
    Also, for each indicator, please list the requirement, the actual number, and then whether it has met the standard or not.
    For example, with minimum number of cases, the column giving the number enrolled and the column giving whether it met the requirement are separated by a couple of columns.

2. Give total columns. (e.g., for "age distribution" one, give for all years; for "number percent enrolled" one, give for the entire year)

3. Include more labels so the tables are self-explanatory. (e.g., for "age distribution" one, label "months";
    for consistent reporting on "site performance" one, list months and the minimum needed).
    An example of confusion for me is in the pie chart in "age distribution"--were these over all years, or just the most recent?

4. For "Culture positive" one, we may want to list the type of method used to confirm the cases in mutually exclusive categories.

Age Distribution :
1. The text "&amp;" appears in a few places - what is this? There needs to be more labelling of the graphs and figures.
2. I don't think the figure on case progression (what I assume is just the cumulative number of cases?) is necessary. It would be better if it was a stacked bar chart by year showing the percent of cases in each age category.

Field population:
1. Can the "%" be taken out of each individual box and be replaced in the header for the column? Would just clean up the table a bit.
2. The columns to the right of "blood result" are a bit confusing - was there a reason for the particular order? Can we change these?

Culture positive and additional lab confirmed cases:
1. Need to describe if these are positive for anything? I think it would be best to have each lab test stratified by Spn, Hi and Nm to give the number of positives (do not combine to give culture - & binax +). These should just be standard analyses and getting into culture negative but binax + is more detail than necessary for these purposes.

Linking:
1. Is the "linked" column the percentage of RRL data linked? Or surveillance data? I assume the former. Need to describe this. And why is the failed link percentage 0 if the linked is not 100%.


Documentation:
- Documentation both admin and user data as a manual.
- RRL upload data doc

DONE:
- A case should not be excluded if the DOB is after the admission date. This should only be a warning. - DONE
- In regards to clearing a date, I don't think any dates the year after should be excluded, i.e. if you are uploading data for 2014 you should allow a date from 2015 to be entered. This is because there will be a small number of cases where a specimen is tested or collected in 2015 if it was enrolled at the end of December. Should only be warning. - DONE
- Gram stain organization - result vs organism - DONE
export format should be cvs/xlsx to allow for excel row limit - DONE (CSV)
region drop down missing - DONE
country filter doesn't work - DONE
