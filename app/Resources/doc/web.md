Recent Cases list
-----------------

To view the list of cases, click **Data Entry** on the sidebar menu, and then **IBD** or **Rotavirus**. Cases are listed in descending order of creation; i.e. newest cases at the top.

To view the details of a specific case in the list, click the eye icon [TODO: insert image] in the **Actions** column.

Only cases that your user account has permission to access are included in the Recent Cases list. Your account permissions also determine which other buttons are displayed in the Actions column.

Finding cases
-------------

To find a specific case, enter or select criteria in the **Filters** panel to the right of the Recent Cases list and click **Find**. The list will be refreshed, showing only cases that match your filter criteria.

You can enter partial values for **System ID** and **Case ID**. The result list will include all cases where the respective field contains whatever you type here.

In the **Region**, **Country**, and **Site** fields, you can hold down `CTRL` and click to select multiple values. The result list will include results that match any of the selected values. Note that each of these fields only appears in the Filters panel if your user account has been administratively configured to allow access to cases with multiple possible values for that field; for example, if your account is restricted to cases in a particular country, the ability to filter on country would be irrelevant, so the Country field is not displayed.

Any filters you apply remain in effect throughout case creation and editing operations. To clear the filters and return to the full list of cases, click the **Reset** button in the Filters panel.

Creating cases
--------------

IDB and Rotavirus cases are created via their respective entries on the **Data Entry** item on the sidebar menu.

1. Click the green **Create/Edit** button above the Recent Cases list.

2. In the **Create Case** pop-up dialog, enter the Case ID.

3. The options included in the **Type** drop-down list depend on your user account permissions. If **Case** is the only option displayed, select it.
  
   If your user account permissions allow it, you may also see **Site Lab**, **RRL** (Regional Reference Lab), or **NL** (National Lab) options. If you select one of these options, you will be taken directly to the lab details editing page. Lab records can also be added later.

4. In the **Site** drop-down list, select the site with which the case is associated.

5. Click **Create/Edit**.

Modifying cases
---------------

If you know the Case ID and Site, you can go directly to the case editing page by the same procedure as above for creating a new case. Otherwise, locate the case in the Recent Cases list and use the buttons in the **Actions** column.

At minimum, the Actions column includes a **Show** button [TODO: insert image] for viewing the case details, an **Edit EPI** button [TODO: insert image], and an **Edit Outcome** button [TODO: insert image]. Buttons for adding and editing lab results will also be displayed if your user account permissions allow you to perform these actions.

Action buttons are also displayed in the upper-right corner of case editing pages. Note that if your browser screen is narrow, the action buttons may be combined into a single gear button [TODO: insert image]. Click the gear button in order to see all the action buttons.
